						secrets told by Luis Fernando Avila Suarez 18:00 26/02/2014<br>
						cookies have been used for years because it stores data/information even if browser has been closed up/shut down or it crashes
						so unique known way to get rid of them is deleting/clearing them by using browsers tools like tools>delete>history or cookies or stuff like that
						most common/regular way is holding/pressing down these keys ctrl+shift+h and there you can choose whats watcha wanna delete (what you want to delete)<br><br>
						set: 		add/(renew/refresh) new cookie | Google Chrome does not reset document.cookie simply appends the given newborn cookie	|<br><br>
						get: 		sort the main string to an array(also known as JSON format/encode),and getting rid off spaces 		|	using split('; ')	|
						loop through it looking into each array position the name/value<br><br>
						delete:	gets wanted/specific cookie and proceeds to expires it using some old fashion date like this ';expires=1 jan 0 00:00:00'.
